Answer the questions in this file after running AFL and CSA on the
all the C programs. The questions are organized into two parts: Part A
concerns with the performance of the tools on programs,
and Part B concerns with the nature of the tools itself.

Part A: Follow the below instructions to fill in the table below.

Each of the C programs contains zero or more division instructions.

First, inspect the code of each program, and fill in its ground truth
(right/wrong) in the Ground Truth column: 

- right if the program does not contain any divide-by-zero errors.
- wrong if the program contains a divide-by-zero error.

Next, refer to the logs of each analyzer's run on each program, and fill
in its result (accept/reject) in the respective column:

- accept if the analyzer does not report any divide-by-zero errors.
- reject if the analyzer reports a divide-by-zero error.

Lastly, use the above computed results to calculate Precision, Recall,
and F1 score for each analyzer on this suite of programs.

Note: 

- F1 score provides a way to combine both precision and recall into a single measure that captures both properties.
The F1 score is calculated as follows: F1 score = (2 * Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

- An accept or a reject (marked by you) does not necessarily mean a FP or a FN. You need decide which accept or reject is 
FP, FN, TP, TN according to Ground Truth. 

- Please fill the results of Precision, Recall, and F1 score in the form of either a value (e.g., 0.8) or a fraction (e.g., 3/5).

- You do not need to fill the results of Precision, Recall, and F1 score for the Ground Truth column.

Part B: Answer the below questions. Provide short
explanations to justify your answers.

Question 1: From the given programs, can AFL be a sound analysis? Can it be complete?



Question 2: From the given programs, can CSA be a sound analysis? Can it be complete?



Question 3: What are the pros and cons of using the CSA to find divide-by-zero errors?  Comment
on both the accuracy and cost of the analyzer under these two domains.
